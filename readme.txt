== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My logo is visible when page is almost ready. What can I do? =

Maybe your logo is really big. Try to upload an small logo. Logos below 100Kb work better because they load faster.

= My page loads to quick and I am unable to see my progress logo =

Congrats! It means that your page is small, or maybe your connection is super fast. You can simulate an slow connection using <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/profile/network-performance/network-conditions">Chrome Dev Tools and throttling option</a>.

= My logo looks terrible. How can I improve its design? =

PNGs files look better because they have transparency. Thus try to use a PNG version of your logo with a background color that fits its main color.
